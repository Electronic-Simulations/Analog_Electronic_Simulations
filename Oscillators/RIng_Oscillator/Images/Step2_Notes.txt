All the graphs are plotted using the data obtained in LTspice. 

Frequency is almost the same. No significant change in Frequency when changing W L parameters in the MOSFETS. It will depends on the input signal.

When increasing the W/L parameter of PMOS both rise and fall time of the inverter will reduced.
